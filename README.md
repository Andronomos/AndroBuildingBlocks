# About
AndroBuildingBlocks is a building block mod for Minecraft with the goal of adding new or variants of vanilla blocks that don't feel out of place or lacking a purpose.

Typically, building block mods tend to add many blocks without any sort of consistent theme or sensible recipes. This often leads to blocks with random names that don't describe what they are and recipes that are just as random or a new crafting table that simply lets you cycle through textures.

AndroBuildingBlocks attempts to avoid this by giving each block an identity and a sensible recipe to match, rather than just being a random cube with a nice texture. This allows the mod to feel more cohesive and less tacked on to the gameplay. 

In short, you'll never see a block with a random or nonsensical name, a custom crafting table that lets you cycle block variants or a recipe made up of random items.
